STORY OF THE HAMBURGER

The hamburger is the most eaten food in the world. An American called Louis Lassen made and sold the first hamburgers in Connecticut in 1895.
Luis called them hamburgers because sailors from Hamburg in Germany gave him the recipe.

Hamburgers became a favorite meal in America in the early part of the twentieth century. Their popularity grew even more after the second world war when they were bought in large quantities by teenagers who preferred fast food to family meals.
In 1848 two brothers Dick and Mac Donald opened a drive-in hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California.

Since then over 25,000 McDonald's restaurants were opened worldwide and now 35 million MacDonald's hamburgers are eaten every day in 115 countries from India to the Arctic Circle.
